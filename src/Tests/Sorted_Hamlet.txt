429  [He may approve our eyes and speak to it.]
430  [He may not, as unvalued persons do,]
431  [He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.]
432  [Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,]
433  [Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,]
434  [Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads]
435  [His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!]
436  [His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,]
437  [His further gait herein, in that the levies,]
438  [His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;]
439  [Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;]
440  [Hold you the watch to-night?]
441  [Holding a weak supposal of our worth,]
442  [Holds such an enmity with blood of man]
443  [Horatio! – or I do forget myself.]
444  [Horatio. 'Tis here!]
445  [Horatio. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.]
446  [Horatio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.]
447  [Horatio. A piece of him.]
448  [Horatio. A truant disposition, good my lord. 375]
449  [Horatio. And then it started, like a guilty thing]
450  [Horatio. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;]
451  [Horatio. As thou art to thyself. 75]
452  [Horatio. Be rul'd. You shall not go.]
453  [Horatio. Before my God, I might not this believe]
454  [Horatio. Do not, my lord!]
455  [Horatio. Do, if it will not stand.]
456  [Horatio. Friends to this ground.]
457  [Horatio. Good my lord, tell it.]
458  [Horatio. Hail to your lordship! 365]
459  [Horatio. Have after. To what issue will this come?]
460  [Horatio. He waxes desperate with imagination. 725]
461  [Horatio. Heaven secure him!]
462  [Horatio. Heaven will direct it.]
463  [Horatio. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.]
464  [Horatio. I think it lacks of twelve.]
465  [Horatio. I warr'nt it will.]
466  [Horatio. In faith,]
467  [Horatio. In what particular thought to work I know not;]
468  [Horatio. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon. 385]
469  [Horatio. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season]
470  [Horatio. Is it a custom? 640]
471  [Horatio. It beckons you to go away with it,]
472  [Horatio. It is a nipping and an eager air.]
473  [Horatio. It was, as I have seen it in his life,]
474  [Horatio. It would have much amaz'd you.]
475  [Horatio. Look, my lord, it comes!]
476  [Horatio. Most constantly. 450]
477  [Horatio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.]
478  [Horatio. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.]
479  [Horatio. My lord, I did; 425]
480  [Horatio. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.]
481  [Horatio. My lord, the King your father.]
482  [Horatio. Nay, very pale.]
483  [Horatio. No, by no means!]
484  [Horatio. Not I, my lord, by heaven!]
485  [Horatio. Not when I saw't.]
486  [Horatio. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!]
487  [Horatio. O, where, my lord?]
488  [Horatio. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.]
489  [Horatio. Propose the oath, my lord. 905]
490  [Horatio. Season your admiration for a while 400]
491  [Horatio. So have I heard and do in part believe it.]
492  [Horatio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak! 65]
493  [Horatio. That can I.]
494  [Horatio. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.]
495  [Horatio. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave 870]
496  [Horatio. There's no offence, my lord.]
497  [Horatio. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.]
498  [Horatio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.]
499  [Horatio. Two nights together had these gentlemen 405]
500  [Horatio. Well, sit we down,]
501  [Horatio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night]
502  [Horatio. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,]
503  [Horatio. What is't, my lord? We will. 890]
504  [Horatio. What news, my lord?]
505  [Horatio. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.]
506  [Horatio.[within] My lord, my lord!]
507  [How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself]
508  [How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable]
509  [Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother]
510  [I could a tale unfold whose lightest word]
511  [I do beseech you give him leave to go.]
512  [I do not set my life at a pin's fee;]
513  [I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!]
514  [I have sworn't. 850]
515  [I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;]
516  [I made to her in marriage, and to decline]
517  [I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.]
518  ['I saw him enter such a house of sale,']
519  [I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,]
520  [I say, away! – Go on. I'll follow thee.]
521  [I shall not look upon his like again. 395]
522  [I stay too long. But here my father comes.]
523  [I think it was to see my mother's wedding.]
524  [I will requite your loves. So, fare you well. 470]
525  [I would know that.]
526  [I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth]
527  [I'll cross it, though it blast me. – Stay illusion! 145]
528  [I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape]
529  [I'll visit you.]
530  [I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,]
531  [If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,]
532  [If she unmask her beauty to the moon.]
533  [If there be any good thing to be done,]
534  [If thou art privy to thy country's fate,]
535  [If thou didst ever thy dear father love-]
536  [If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,]
537  [If with too credent ear you list his songs,]
538  [If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,]
539  [If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,]
540  [Importing the surrender of those lands]
541  [In dreadful secrecy impart they did,]
542  [In equal scale weighing delight and dole,]
543  [In filial obligation for some term]
544  [In going back to school in Wittenberg,]
545  [In honourable fashion.]
546  [In obstinate condolement is a course]
547  [In the dead vast and middle of the night]
548  [In the most high and palmy state of Rome, 130]
549  [In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,]
550  [In this distracted globe. Remember thee? 835]
551  [In which the majesty of buried Denmark]
552  [Is by a forged process of my death]
553  [Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,]
554  [Is not this something more than fantasy?]
555  [Is the main motive of our preparations,]
556  [It fits your wisdom so far to believe it]
557  [It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.']
558  [It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you. 885]
559  [It is most retrograde to our desire;]
560  [It is not, nor it cannot come to good.]
561  [It lifted up it head and did address]
562  [It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,]
563  [It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.]
564  [It waves you to a more removed ground.]
565  [Itself to motion, like as it would speak;]
566  [Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,]
567  [King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?]
568  [Laertes. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well 570]
569  [Laertes. Farewell. Exit.]
570  [Laertes. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,]
571  [Laertes. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.]
572  [Laertes. My dread lord,]
573  [Laertes. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.]
574  [Laertes. O, fear me not!]
575  [Laertes. Think it no more.]
576  [Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,]
577  [Let it be tenable in your silence still;]
578  [Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell 675]
579  [Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman! – 350]
580  [Let not the royal bed of Denmark be 820]
581  [Let us impart what we have seen to-night]
582  [Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know]
583  [Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she]
584  [Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.]
585  [Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, 545]
586  [Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.]
587  [Look you, I'll go pray.]
588  [Lost by his father, with all bands of law,]
589  [Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,]
590  [Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;]
591  [Making night hideous, and we fools of nature]
592  [(Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch]
593  [Marcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.]
594  [Marcellus. 'Tis gone!]
595  [Marcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.]
596  [Marcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,]
597  [Marcellus. Holla, Bernardo! 25]
598  [Marcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,]
599  [Marcellus. How is't, my noble lord?]
600  [Marcellus. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!]
601  [Marcellus. Is it not like the King?]
602  [Marcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock. 180]
603  [Marcellus. It is offended.]
604  [Marcellus. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.]
605  [Marcellus. Look with what courteous action]
606  [Marcellus. Lord Hamlet!]
607  [Marcellus. My good lord!]
608  [Marcellus. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.]
609  [Marcellus. Nay, let's follow him. 730]
610  [Marcellus. No, it is struck. 630]
611  [Marcellus. Nor I, my lord- in faith.]
612  [Marcellus. Nor I, my lord.]
613  [Marcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier.]
614  [Marcellus. O, wonderful! 860]
615  [Marcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!]
616  [Marcellus. Question it, Horatio.]
617  [Marcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan? 160]
618  [Marcellus. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.]
619  [Marcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.]
620  [Marcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,]
621  [Marcellus. We have sworn, my lord, already.]
622  [Marcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night? 30]
623  [Marcellus. You shall not go, my lord.]
624  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] Arm'd, my lord. 440]
625  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] Longer, longer. 455]
626  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] My lord, from head to foot.]
627  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] We do, my lord.]
628  [Marcellus.[with Horatio] Ay, by heaven, my lord.]
629  [Marcellus.[with Horatio] My lord, we will not.]
630  [Marcellus?]
631  [Mark you,]
632  [May do t' express his love and friending to you, 940]
633  [May give his saying deed; which is no further]
634  [May sweep to my revenge.]
635  [More honour'd in the breach than the observance.]
636  [Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust 810]
637  [Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him]
638  [Must render up myself.]
639  [My custom always of the afternoon,]
640  [My father's brother, but no more like my father]
641  [My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.]
642  [My father- methinks I see my father. 390]
643  [My lord, not I. 895]
644  [My tables! Meet it is I set it down 845]
645  [My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France]
646  [My uncle?]
647  [Nay, come, let's go together. 945]
648  [Neither a borrower nor a lender be;]
649  [Never to speak of this that you have heard:]
650  [No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,]
651  [No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day]
652  [No more.]
653  [No reckoning made, but sent to my account]
654  [No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,]
655  [Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.]
656  [Nor customary suits of solemn black,]
657  [Nor shall you do my ear that violence]
658  [Nor the dejected havior of the visage,]
659  [Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,]
660  [Not of that dye which their investments show, 615]
661  [Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,]
662  [Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.]
663  [Now wears his crown.]
664  [(O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason]
665  [O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, 785]
666  [O most pernicious woman!]
667  [O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!]
668  [O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power]
669  [O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,]
670  [O, speak!]
671  [Occasion smiles upon a second leave. 540]
672  [Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware]
673  [Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,]
674  [Of general assault.]
675  [Of his affection to me.]
676  [Of his behaviour.]
677  [Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;]
678  [Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;]
679  [Of man and country- 1000]
680  [Of mine own eyes.]
681  [Of these dilated articles allow. [Gives a paper.]]
682  [Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress 230]
683  [Of this post-haste and romage in the land.]
684  [Of unimproved mettle hot and full,]
685  [Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,]
686  [Ophelia. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,]
687  [Ophelia. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, 600]
688  [Ophelia. Do you doubt that?]
689  [Ophelia. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders]
690  [Ophelia. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,]
691  [Ophelia. I shall obey, my lord.]
692  [Ophelia. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep]
693  [Ophelia. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love]
694  [Ophelia. No more but so?]
695  [Ophelia. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.]
696  [Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' 930]
697  [Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, 595]
698  [Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,]
699  [Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens]
700  [Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!]
701  [Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life 155]
702  [Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open 515]
703  [Or such ambiguous giving out, to note]
704  [Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd 335]
705  [Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,]
706  [Or thinking by our late dear brother's death]
707  [Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff]
708  [Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. 320]
709  [Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, 220]
710  [Out of his subject; and we here dispatch]
711  [Out of the shot and danger of desire.]
712  [Passing through nature to eternity. 275]
713  [Perchance 'twill walk again.]
714  [Polonius. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well. 965]
715  [Polonius. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,]
716  [Polonius. And let him ply his music.]
717  [Polonius. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?]
718  [Polonius. At 'closes in the consequence'– Ay, marry!]
719  [Polonius. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!]
720  [Polonius. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,]
721  [Polonius. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,]
722  [Polonius. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.]
723  [Polonius. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.]
724  [Polonius. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!]
725  [Polonius. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave 260]
726  [Polonius. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby]
727  [Polonius. Marry, sir, here's my drift,]
728  [Polonius. Marry, well bethought!]
729  [Polonius. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,]
730  [Polonius. Observe his inclination in yourself.]
731  [Polonius. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.]
732  [Polonius. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you? 575]
733  [Polonius. Wherefore should you do this?]
734  [Polonius. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!]
735  [Polonius. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo, 950]
736  [Possess it merely. That it should come to this!]
737  [Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, 775]
738  [Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.]
739  [Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,]
740  [Reynaldo. As gaming, my lord.]
741  [Reynaldo. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and]
742  [Reynaldo. Ay, my lord,]
743  [Reynaldo. Ay, very well, my lord.]
744  [Reynaldo. But, my good lord- 985]
745  [Reynaldo. Good my lord! [Going.]]
746  [Reynaldo. I shall, my lord. 1025]
747  [Reynaldo. I will, my lord.]
748  [Reynaldo. My lord, I did intend it.]
749  [Reynaldo. My lord, I have.]
750  [Reynaldo. My lord, that would dishonour him.]
751  [Reynaldo. Very good, my lord.]
752  [Reynaldo. Well, my lord.]
753  [Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.]
754  [Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?]
755  [See you now-]
756  [Seek for thy noble father in the dust.]
757  [Seem to me all the uses of this world!]
758  [Set your entreatments at a higher rate]
759  [Shall in the general censure take corruption]
760  [Shall you my son. You have me, have you not? 1020]
761  [Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, 115]
762  [She married. O, most wicked speed, to post 360]
763  [Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,]
764  [Since nature cannot choose his origin, —]
765  [Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,]
766  [So by his father lost; and this, I take it,]
767  [So excellent a king, that was to this]
768  [So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,]
769  [So grace and mercy at your most need help you,]
770  [So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.]
771  [So horridly to shake our disposition]
772  [So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,]
773  [So nightly toils the subject of the land,]
774  [So oft it chances in particular men]
775  [So to seduce! – won to his shameful lust]
776  [So, by my former lecture and advice,]
777  [So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:]
778  [Soil our addition; and indeed it takes]
779  [Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes]
780  [Speak of it! Stay, and speak! – Stop it, Marcellus!]
781  [Speak to me.]
782  [Speak to me.]
783  [[Spreads his arms.]]
784  [Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me 415]
785  [Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.]
786  [Such as it is; and for my own poor part,]
787  [Such was the very armour he had on]
788  [Swear by my sword.]
789  [Swear by my sword.]
790  [Swear.]
791  [Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive]
792  [Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. 555]
793  [Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,]
794  [Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;]
795  [Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd]
796  [Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies]
797  [Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,]
798  [Than I to Hercules. Within a month,]
799  [Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, 610]
800  [Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. 920]
801  [Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. 250]
802  [Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,]
803  [Than that which dearest father bears his son]
804  [Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.]
805  [Than your particular demands will touch it. 960]
806  [That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,]
807  [That are so fortified against our story,]
808  [That beetles o'er his base into the sea,]
809  ['That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,]
810  [That ever I was born to set it right!]
811  [That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound]
812  [That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature 340]
813  [That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,]
814  [That he is open to incontinency.]
815  [That he might not beteem the winds of heaven 345]
816  [That it went hand in hand even with the vow]
817  [That looks so many fadoms to the sea 710]
818  [That may to thee do ease, and, grace to me, 150]
819  [That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;]
820  [That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, 770]
821  [That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?]
822  [That swift as quicksilver it courses through]
823  [That they do know my son, come you more nearer]
824  [That they may seem the taints of liberty,]
825  [That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,]
826  [That was and is the question of these wars.]
827  [That we with wisest sorrow think on him]
828  [That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,]
829  [That you know aught of me- this is not to do,]
830  [That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,]
831  [That youth and observation copied there,]
832  [That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly 980]
833  [That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,]
834  [That, if again this apparition come,]
835  [Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!]
836  [The apparition comes. I knew your father. 420]

1029  [You do not understand yourself so clearly]
1030  [You laying these slight sullies on my son]
1031  [You must not put another scandal on him,]
1032  [You must not take for fire. From this time]
1033  [You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?]
1034  [You, as your business and desires shall point you, 875]
1035  [You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,]
1036  [Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; 1015]
1037  [Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone 215]
1038  [Your leave and favour to return to France;]
1039  [Your party in converse, him you would sound,]
1040  [Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.]
1041  [gentleman.' 1005]
